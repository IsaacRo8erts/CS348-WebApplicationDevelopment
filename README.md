# Forum Website for Discussing Basketball

During my third year of university I created a forum-based website for discussing basketball. A user can create an account, log in, and add friends. They can create posts and view other posts created by thier friends. A user can interact with their friends posts by commenting. A user can view a list of all their previous posts on their profile. I would like to add more functionality to my website in the future, such as letting a user select an emoji to react with to their freinds post.
